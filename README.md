# Music and Smoking Habits Analysis

**Course:** DSA-210 at Sabancı University  
**Author:** Emir Emre Aydın 

## Motivation  
As someone who listens to music almost all day long, I have always been curious about how music influences my mood and habits. Since October 4th, I have been tracking my daily smoking habits. The motivation behind this project is to explore whether music genres, artists, or external factors such as exam dates impact my smoking behavior. By analyzing this data, I aim to uncover patterns and understand the triggers that influence my smoking habits with a specific focus on the role of music.

## Tools  
- **Spyder (Python IDE):** For coding and development.  
- **Pandas:** For data cleaning, filtering, and structuring.  
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For creating visualizations to identify trends and correlations.  
- **Scikit-learn:** For applying machine learning models to find potential predictors of smoking habits.  
- **Numpy:** For numerical computations.  
- **Scipy:** For statistical analysis of the relationships between variables.  
- **Spotify API:** For importing and analyzing music data.
- **Spotify Request Data Section:** For importing and analyzing music data.

## Data Sources  
-This project utilizes a combination of self-collected and externally sourced data to analyze the factors influencing smoking habits, particularly focusing on the role of music. By integrating these diverse data sources, the analysis aims to uncover patterns and relationships between daily smoking habits, music preferences, and external events. This multifaceted approach provides a richer understanding of behavioral triggers and trends. The data sources include:
- **Personal Smoking Habit Data:**  
  - Daily smoking habits logged manually since October 4th.  
  - Includes date and notes such as mood and events (e.g., exams).  

- **Spotify Data:**  
  - Imported using the Spotify API and Spotify Request History data. 
  - Includes data like artists, genres, songs, listening time, and duration.  

- **External Events:**  
  - Calendar events such as exam dates and other life events to contextualize behavior.  

## Methodology  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyze daily smoking behavior and identify trends.  
   - Explore correlations between music preferences and smoking frequency.  

2. **Statistical Analysis:**  
   - Use correlation and regression techniques to identify significant relationships.  
   - Evaluate external events’ impact on smoking habits.   

3. **Visualization:**  
   - Create visualizations to present the findings clearly and effectively.
